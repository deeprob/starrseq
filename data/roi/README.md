**This folder contains all the files that describe the regions of interests (ROIs) of a focused STARR-Seq experiment**

# Description of files in this folder
1. enhancer_master_list_HEK293_ENCODE.xlsx - The chromosomal coordinates of the ROIs are in this excel document prepared by Maitreya.
2. enhancer_master_list_hek293.bed - The chromosomal coordinates of the ROIs along with information about presence of possible TF motifs in bed format prepared by parsing the information in *enhancer_master_list_HEK293_ENCODE.xlsx* file. **TODO: add script here**
3. master.sorted.bed - The chromosomal coordinates of the ROIs sorted by location. **TODO: add script here**
4. master.sorted.fa - A fasta file with ROIs and their sequence. **TODO: add script here**
5. master.sorted.seq.bed - A bed file with ROIs and their sequence. **TODO: add script here**
