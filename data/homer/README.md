**This folder contains all the files required by homer for analyzing the ROIs**

# Description of files in this folder
1. master.homer.bed - The chromosomal coordinates of the ROIs in bed format compatible with homer.
2. master.homer.window.bed - The chromosomal coordinates of the ROIs broken up into smaller fragments of window size 500 and stride 50 in a homer compatible bed format. **TODO: add script here**
3. roi.homer.window.bed - The chromosomal coordinates of the ROIs broken up into smaller fragments of window size 500 and stride 50 in a homer compatible bed format. **TODO: add script here and figure out the diff between this script and the one above**
4. homer.motifs - All motifs used by homer along with their PWMs. **TODO: add script here**
5. metadata_motif.json - All homer motif ids mapped to RNASeq gene name. **TODO: add script here**
6. metadata_motif_test.json - All homer motif ids mapped to RNASeq gene name. **TODO: add script here and figure out if there is any difference between this and 5**
